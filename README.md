Wine Quality Prediction:
Setting  a continous integration system we will automatically rebuild your model and reevaluate it.
Continous Machine Learning (CML)
# WineML

WineML is a data science and machine learning project focused on analyzing wine-related data using advanced machine learning techniques.

## Overview

WineML leverages the power of machine learning to extract valuable insights from wine data. Whether you're interested in predicting wine quality, understanding flavor profiles, or exploring trends in the wine industry, WineML provides a robust framework for data analysis and model development.

## Features

- **Data Exploration:** Explore various datasets related to wine, including information about grape varieties, wine regions, and sensory characteristics.
- **Model Training:** Build machine learning models to predict wine quality, classify wine types, or perform other tasks based on the available data.
- **Continuous Integration:** Utilize GitHub Actions and Continuous Machine Learning (CML) for automated model training, testing, and evaluation as part of a seamless CI/CD pipeline.

## Getting Started

To get started with WineML, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone the WineML repository to your local machine using Git:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Vipul251/Wine-ML.git
    ```

2. **Set Up Environment**: Set up your Python environment and install the necessary dependencies using `pip`:

    ```bash
    cd wineml
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Explore the Notebooks**: Explore the Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks` directory to learn about the data and experiment with machine learning models.

4. **Customize Workflows**: Customize the GitHub Actions workflows in the `.github/workflows` directory to define the CI/CD pipeline for your specific needs.

5. **Run Workflows**: Commit your changes and push them to your forked repository on GitHub to trigger the CI/CD workflows.
